# QuaternionIsomorphisms
Magma implementation of our algorithm for computing an explicit isomorphism between quaternion algebras over a quadratic function field in odd characteristic.  
Tests procedure for some of the subroutines are given in the file Tests.magma, as well as a procedure called completeTest which attempts to run the whole algorithm.
